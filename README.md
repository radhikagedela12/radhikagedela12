💥 Fun fact: I traded in my pharmacy tools for Python scripts and SQL queries. Now I’m diagnosing healthcare data and optimizing outcomes with precision! 📈🧠


🚀 What I’m up to: Diving deep into healthcare data analytics, building predictive models for patient outcomes, and using advanced tools like R, Python, and SQL to make sense of complex data in the healthcare space. I'm on a mission to transform health systems with data-driven insights.

🌱 Skills I’m honing: Machine learning, predictive analytics, and natural language processing for better health insights and patient care.
